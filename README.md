This project is being developed to take the standard of some basic structures from the project as a single guide, rather than searching for suitable implementations from different sources while working on any spring boot backend project. In the project development, it is aimed to implement best practices with a general structure that can be taken as a basis in all projects. The project is in the beginning stage and I will add developments in my free time.
